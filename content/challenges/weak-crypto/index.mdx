## Challenge Overview

A certificate authority was compromised using weak RSA keys. The attacker used small prime numbers making factorization possible. Factor the provided public key to decrypt the message and recover the flag.

## Learning Objectives

- Apply crypto analysis techniques
- Use professional security tools
- Understand real-world attack scenarios
- Document findings professionally

## Tools You May Need

- Python with sympy or gmpy2
- factordb.com for factorization
- OpenSSL for key operations

## Getting Started

1. Review the challenge description carefully
2. Gather and examine all provided materials
3. Apply systematic analysis methodology
4. Document your findings as you progress
5. Submit the flag when discovered

## Flag Format

All flags follow the format: `ung{descriptive_text}`

Good luck!
