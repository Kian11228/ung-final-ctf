## Challenge Overview

You have low-privilege SSH access to a Linux server. Identify privilege escalation vectors such as SUID binaries, sudo misconfigurations, or exploitable services to gain root access and capture the flag.

## Learning Objectives

- Apply misc analysis techniques
- Use professional security tools
- Understand real-world attack scenarios
- Document findings professionally

## Tools You May Need

- LinPEAS enumeration script
- GTFOBins reference
- SSH access to target

## Getting Started

1. Review the challenge description carefully
2. Gather and examine all provided materials
3. Apply systematic analysis methodology
4. Document your findings as you progress
5. Submit the flag when discovered

## Flag Format

All flags follow the format: `ung{descriptive_text}`

Good luck!
