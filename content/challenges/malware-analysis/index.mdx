## Challenge Overview

Reverse engineer a custom APT malware sample. The binary uses XOR encryption to hide its command and control configuration. Perform static and dynamic analysis to extract the C2 domain and flag.

## Learning Objectives

- Apply reversing analysis techniques
- Use professional security tools
- Understand real-world attack scenarios
- Document findings professionally

## Tools You May Need

- Ghidra or IDA for disassembly
- x64dbg for debugging
- Strings and hex editors

## Getting Started

1. Review the challenge description carefully
2. Gather and examine all provided materials
3. Apply systematic analysis methodology
4. Document your findings as you progress
5. Submit the flag when discovered

## Flag Format

All flags follow the format: `ung{descriptive_text}`

Good luck!
